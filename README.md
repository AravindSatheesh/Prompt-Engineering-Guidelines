# Prompt-Engineering-Guidelines

This Repo is developed to serve as a cheatsheet consisting of best practices of Prompt Engineering.

Content from [**ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers**](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/1/introduction) short course in Deeplearning.ai platform has been used for creating this cheatsheet.

The Deeplearning Course materials use OpenAI's "3.5 Turbo" model, but we use "Llama" model for our convenience. We can use any model based on our requirements.

We can save our API Key in "api_key.txt" file within Setup Files. I have not saved it here for security reasons. Here we have used Together AI API Key as it has free credits for initial use. For playing around, this is sufficient. Refer -> https://api.together.xyz/
